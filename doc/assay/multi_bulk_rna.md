## Usage
1. Make a rna genomeDir

Please refer to [rna](multi_rna.md) assay.

2. Generate scripts for each sample

Under your working directory, write a shell script `run.sh` as

```
multi_bulk_rna\
	--mapfile ./rna.mapfile\
	--genomeDir {path to hs_ensembl_99 or mmu_ensembl_99}\
    --barcode_sample barcode_sample.tsv \
	--thread 16\
	--mod shell
```
`--mapfile` Required.  Mapfile is a tab-delimited text file with as least three columns. Each line of mapfile represents paired-end fastq files.

1st column: Fastq file prefix.  
2nd column: Fastq file directory path.  
3rd column: Sample name, which is the prefix of all output files.  

Example

Sample1 has 2 paired-end fastq files located in 2 different directories(fastq_dir1 and fastq_dir2). Sample2 has 1 paired-end fastq file located in fastq_dir1.
```
$cat ./my.mapfile
fastq_prefix1	fastq_dir1	sample1
fastq_prefix2	fastq_dir2	sample1
fastq_prefix3	fastq_dir1	sample2

$ls fastq_dir1
fastq_prefix1_1.fq.gz	fastq_prefix1_2.fq.gz
fastq_prefix3_1.fq.gz	fastq_prefix3_2.fq.gz

$ls fastq_dir2
fastq_prefix2_1.fq.gz	fastq_prefix2_2.fq.gz
```

`--genomeDir` Required. The path of the genome directory after running `celescope rna mkref`.

`--barcode_sample` Required. Tsv file of well barcodes and sample names. The first column are well barcodes and the second column are sample names.

`--thread` Threads to use. The recommended setting is 8, and the maximum should not exceed 20.

`--mod` Create `sjm`(simple job manager https://github.com/StanfordBioinformatics/SJM) or `shell` scripts. 


After you `sh run.sh`, a `shell` directory containing `{sample}.sh` files will be generated.

1. Start the analysis by running:
```
sh ./shell/{sample}.sh
```
Note that the `./shell/{sample}.sh` must be run under the working directory(You shouldn't run them under the `shell` directory)

## Main Ouput

- outs/*_matrix.tsv.gz: Gene expression UMI matrix, where rows represent gene IDs and columns correspond to samples.

- 02.split_fastq/{sample}_fq.gz: R2 FASTQ files split based on well barcodes. The UMI sequence is appended to the read name, separated by a semicolon.
